# FSImage is the 'file system image'. Default the VM will access EEMBC.jar
# the eembc.jar has been mapped into /src/vm/os/$(os_family)/FSImage.c by
# TCL Script: /internal_misc/make_fs_image.tcl. If you want the VM to access
# specified jar files, you need to copy all jar files into a directory, 
# and define FSIMAGE_SRCS which points to this directory.  Then all files 
# in this directory are mapped in FSImage.c,
# such that they will be accessible by the OsFile_$(os_family) functions.
#
# Note 1: If your computer doesn't support TCL Script or you don't specified p
# the File System Image, please don't define FSIMAGE_SRCS

# Note 2: currently you may not have subdirectories inside
# $(FSIMAGE_SRCS).
