; This is the scatter-load file for linking cldc_vm.axf. We place the
; interesting pieces of the VM into different memory addresses so that
; we can test the VM with different memory speed.
;
;
; Regular code and data: 0x00008000 - 0x00ffffff  16MB
; C stackheap:           0x01000000 - 0x03ffffff  48MB; This is also where
;                                                       Java heap is malloc'ed
; Hot Routines, etc:     0x04000000 - 0x04fffff   16MB
;
; For example, the Java heap is placed at address 0x01000000. We can
; run the experiment "what if the entire heap is in fast memory" by
; benchmarking the VM with two different memory map configurations
; (assuming CPU is 10 Mhz)
;
; [configuration1: everything is in slow memory (2 wait states)]
; 00000000 05000000 RAM 2 rw 300/300 300/300
;
; [configuration1: heap is in fast memory (0 wait state), everything
; else is in slow memory (2 wait states)]
; 00000000 01000000 RAM 2 rw 100/100 100/100      (slow)
; 01000000 03000000 RAM 2 rw 300/300 300/300      (fast)
; 04000000 01000000 RAM 2 rw 100/100 100/100      (slow)
