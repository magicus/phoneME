/* TypeIDs: Internal Mechanics / What's under the covers?
   =====================================================
   Before reading this, please read the comment lock at the top of typeid.h
   to understand some of the abstract concepts that will be referred to
   below.

   NOTE: Most of the data structures discussed here are defined in
   typeid_impl.h.

   TypeID Databases / Storage
   ==========================
   Inside the typeID system, there are 4 databases:

   1. CVMtypeidClassEntries       - tracks class names
   2. CVMtypeidNameEntries        - tracks field and method names
   3. CVMtypeidMethodSigEntries   - tracks method signatures
   4. CVMtypeidNameAndTypeEntries - track name and type pairs

   Let's abbreviate these databases as classEntries, nameEntries,
   methodSigEntries, and nameAndTypeEntries respectively.

   All of these databases are instantiated as const data structures in
   romjavaAux.c which is generated by the romizer.  Most (if not all)
   of the code responsible for emitting these databases in romjavaAux.c
   is in jcc/runtime/CVMWriter.java.

   However, there is a way to expand these databases with additional
   entries in RAM.  This additional entries are stored in segments.
   Runtime (as opposed to romizer time) created typeIDs are stored in
   these RAM segments.


   TypeID Segments
   ===============
   All the typeID databases are organized as chunky arrays consisting of
   the following segment types respectively:

   1. CVMtypeidClassSegment       - holds class entries
   2. CVMtypeidNameSegment        - holds name entries
   3. CVMtypeidMethodSigSegment   - holds methodSig entries
   4. CVMtypeidNameAndTypeSegment - holds nameAndType entries

   While the first segment in the chunky arrays are emitted as const arrays
   by the romizer, the linkage is in a RAM variable.

   When the typeID system needs to find a free entry in the databases, it will
   first try to look for one in existing segments of the database.  If one is
   found, it will be used.

   If not free entry can be found, the system will instantiate a new segment.

   Instantiating Segments + Segment Sizes
   ======================================
   The size of the next segment to be allocated in RAM is determined by the
   following values respectively for each database:

   1. CVMglobals.typeidClassSegmentSize
   2. CVMglobals.typeidNameSegmentSize
   3. CVMglobals.typeidMethodSigSegmentSize
   4. CVMglobals.typeidNameAndTypeSegmentSize

   Initially, in CVMtypeidInit(), these sizes are set to INITIAL_SEGMENT_SIZE.
   That means the very first time that a new segment is instantiated, it will
   be instantiated with size INITIAL_SEGMENT_SIZE.

   findFreeTableEntry() is responsible for instantiating the new segments.
   Each time, after instantiating a new segment, it will increase the above
   size values by a growth ratio.

   Currently, that ratio is hardcoded in findFreeTableEntry() as 3 /2 i.e.
   150%.  This means that the second segment will be able to hold
   1.5 * INITIAL_SEGMENT_SIZE entries.  The third segment to be instantiated
   will be able to hold 1.5 * 1.5 * INITIAL_SEGMENT_SIZE entries.  And so
   forth.

   Currently, all 4 databases have the same INITIAL_SEGMENT_SIZE and growth
   rate.  If desirable, the code can be changed later to allow these to
   differ to fit their respective usage profiles better.


   What's in the database?
   ======================
   The segments contain the following entry types for the respective databases:
   
   1. CVMtypeidClassEntry
   2. CVMtypeidNameEntry
   3. CVMtypeidMethodSigEntry
   4. CVMtypeidNameAndTypeEntry

   All of these entries are different in size, and are designed to contain
   different types of information.  See their definitions in typeid_impl.h
   for details of what is contained in them.


   Accessing entries in databases
   ==============================
   We said earlier that the databases are essentially chunky arrays.  However,
   these arrays are not even in size (as discussed in "Segment Sizes" above).

   Therefore, each entry has an array index.  Conceptually, to access the
   entry, we just index to the array.  For example:

       myClassEntry = CVMtypeidClassEntries[myClassEntryIndex]

   However, because the array is chunky, we need to use a function to do the
   indexing into the segments.  That function is indexSegmentedTable().  For
   each of the databases, there are 4 convenience wrapper macros that call
   this function on their behalf:

   1. indexClass()
   2. indexName()
   3. indexMethodSig()
   4. indexNameAndType()


   Which typeID goes into which database?
   =====================================
   classIDs are effectively indexes into CVMtypeidClassEntries and corresponds
   to a CVMtypeidClassEntry record.

   fieldIDs are built from nameIDs and sigIDs:

       The field nameIDs are indexes into CVMtypeidNameEntries and corresponds
       to a CVMtypeidNameEntry record.

       The field sigID is a classID, because fields are labels for instances
       of classes (or you can think of it that way).  Hence, they are indexes
       into CVMtypeidClassEntries and corresponds to a CVMtypeidClassEntry
       record.

       NOTE: this means that classIDs and field sigIDs share the same namespace
       (are located in the same database) and are not independent of each other.

   methodIDs are built from nameIDs and sigIDs:

       The method nameIDs are indexes into CVMtypeidNameEntries and corresponds
       to a CVMtypeidNameEntry record.

       NOTE: this means that method nameIDs and field nameIDs share the same
       namespace (are located in the same database) and are not independent
       of each other.

       The method sigID is an index into CVMtypeidMethodSigEntries and
       corresponds to a CVMtypeidMethodSigEntry record.

   What about the nameAndTypeEntries?
   =================================
   Conceptually, every fieldID and methodID corresponds to a nameAndTypeEntry.
   The nameAndTypeEntry serves to hold the pair of nameID and sigID as
   described above.

   However, in practice, that is not always the case.  First, let's look at the
   classID and memberID tokens ...

   The classID Token
   =================
   classIDs are CVMSimpleTypeIDs which ultimately contains a token of type
   CVMTypeIDToken which is an integer type.  For 32 bit typeIDs, the
   CVMTypeIDToken is 32 bits in size.

   The classID token's bit structure is as follows:

             arrayDepth  baseType
       bits       8         24

   where ...

       baseType is the classID for a non-array type.  That means that for
       non-array types, the arrayDepth field is always 0.  The baseType
       is a true index into CVMtypeidClassEntries.

       arrayType is the array depth of the array type.  8 bits allows us
       a max depth of 255.  This happens to be the max array depth allowed
       the VM spefication.

       Hence, array types don't actually have an entry in the classEntries
       database.  The array type classID is represented by a baseType
       classID which has an entry in the classEntries database.  And in
       addition, the array type classID has a non-zero value in the
       arrayDepth field indicating the depth of the array.
       
   The memberID Token
   ==================
   memberIDs (i.e. fieldIDs and methodIDs) are represented by
   CVMCompositeTypeID structs.  For the 32 bit typeID system, we want to
   keep the tokens as 32 bit values.  Note that the size of the
   CVMCompositeTypeID struct would be 64 bit in this case.

   Hence, the memberID token is represented in 2 forms:
   1. small memberIDs
   2. big memberIDs

   Small memberID Tokens
   =====================
   The small memberID tokens are encoded as follows:

              name   arrayDepth   baseType   marker
       bits    16         2           13        1

   where ...

       marker is a bit that, if set, indicates that the memberID token is of
       the small memberID encoding (above) as opposed to the big memberID
       encoding below.

       baseType maps to the lower 12 bits of the sigID component of the
       memberID.

       arrayDepth maps to bit 24 and 25 of the sigID component of the memberID.

       name maps to the lower 17 bits of the nameID component of the memberID.

   For fieldIDs, the arrayDepth and baseType fields correspond to a subset of
   the classID token which represents the field's type.

   For methodIDs, arrayDepth and baseType has no meaning.  However, small
   methodID tokens are encoded in the same pattern as small fieldID tokens for
   consistency.  Otherwise, another marker bit will be needed to distinguish
   between the 2 encodings.  You can think of the arrayType and baseType
   labels merely as names of bit regions in the method sigID.

   And yes, for methodIDs, it makes no sense to favor bit 24-25 of the sigID
   unlike for fieldIDs which uses it for array depths.  But that is the cost
   of consistency.

   In case it wasn't clear, small methodIDs are encoded and decoded using the
   exact same algorithm as small fieldIDs.  Therefore, the method sigIDs will
   be torn apart into 2 parts: bits 24-25, and bits 0-12.  These 2 parts will
   be encoded into the small memberID as if they are the arrayDepth and
   baseType of a classID.

   Big memberID Tokens
   ===================
   The big memberID tokens are encoded as the address of a CVMCompositeTypeID
   struct.  Which compositeID struct?  Well, the one in the nameAndTypeEntry.

   Hence, when a big memberID token is needed, a nameAndTypeEntry is created
   in the nameAndTypeEntries database to represent the nameID and sigID pair.
   The nameAndTypeEntry struct has a CVMCompositeTypeID field.  The address
   of that field is taken as the big memberID token.

   Note: nameAndTypeEntry structs actually tracks the bit patterns in
   nameID and sigID tokens, and not the fieldIDs or methodIDs that they
   correspond to.  Hence, if a fieldID and methodID both have identical
   nameID and sigID token values, they can share the same nameAndTypeEntry.

   This sharing not a problem because fieldIDs and methodIDs are conceptually
   in different namespaces.  You should never compare a fieldID and methodID
   and expect to be able to tell them apart.  Hence, they can afford to
   share the same namespace without collision problems.

   Why have small memberID tokens at all?
   =====================================
   Big memberID tokens require a nameAndTypeEntry struct.  This consumes
   memory.  If the values of the memberID's nameID and sigID tokens are small
   enough, it is possible to encode the memberID token completely in a 32 bit
   integer value instead of requiring memory to store the nameID and sigID
   token values.  Hence, the small memberID token was created.

   Why 17-2-12-1?
   =============
   Yeah, why not have 15, 2, 14, 1 bits (or any other permutation) for the
   small memberID token bit fields?  The answer is because some profiling has
   shown that the number of field names that are loaded by the VM exceeded
   the number of class names by a factor of about 23.

   Hence, using a 17-2-12-1 distribution gives us 32 times more room for
   nameIDs than classIDs.  This increases the probability of avoiding the
   need of a big memberID token and memory for a corresponding
   nameAndTypeEntry.

   If it can be demonstrated that a different bit ratio is more efficient,
   then the shift and bit mask values in the following places should be
   changed to match accordingly:

   1. referenceNameAndType() in typeid.c
   2. CVMtypeidGetMemberName() in typeid.h
   3. CVMtypeidGetMemberTypeX() in typeid.h
   4. vm.CVMNameAndTypeEntry.lookupEnter() in jcc/vm/CVMNameAndTypeEntry.java
